This repo contains several and loosely coupled documents supporting open collaboration during
development of these documents. General end goal for these documents will mostly likely be a
published page on [federatief.datastelsel.nl](https://federatief.datastelsel.nl).

Currently under development docs can be found @ **[ibds-fds.github.io/open-collab/](https://ibds-fds.github.io/open-collab/)**

## Development

To start a new doc for open collaboration, follow these steps:

- Create a new Markdown file in `docs/` (new file with ends with `.md`)
- Add the following lines at the top of the document:
  
  ```
  ---
  layout: default
  ---
  ```
- Add the doc to [index.md](./index.md) to publish it into the GitHub Pages site
- Open [HackMD.io](https://hackmd.io/) and import a new note from GitHub (ask Marc for support)
- Add info to the document about how and where to edit it with the HackMD share link
